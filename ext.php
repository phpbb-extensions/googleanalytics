*
* NOTE TO EXTENSION DEVELOPERS:
* Normally it is not necessary to define any functions inside the ext class below.
* The ext class may contain special (un)installation commands in the methods
* enable_step(), disable_step() and purge_step(). As it is, these methods are defined
* in phpbb_extension_base, which this class extends, but you can overwrite them to
* give special instructions for those cases. Board Rules must do this because it uses
* the notifications system, which requires the methods enable_notifications(),
* disable_notifications() and purge_notifications() be run to properly manage the
* notifications created by Board Rules when enabling, disabling or deleting this
* extension.
